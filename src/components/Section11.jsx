            <h2>Google Ads specialist, coach & trainer</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in the Achterhoek and am almost 30. In 2022 we sold our house. Since then we live and work from our self-built camper. Together with Tara & Jip I am looking for the most beautiful places in Europe. By day, I am a Google Ads specialist who is thorough in his profession. In the evenings and weekends I am an adventurer and bon vivant.</p>
