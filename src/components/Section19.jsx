                <p>You have been working with Google Ads for quite some time now, and you have mastered the basics. You navigate through the Google Ads interface like Speedy Gonzales; you know the Google Ads Editor like the back of your hand and creating new campaigns is done in minutes, not hours. <br /><br /> You just notice youâ€™re hitting the ceiling. You want to take the next step as a Google Ads specialist. You are looking for confirmation and would like to be able to spar at a high level. Do you recognize this? Then my unique 1-on-1 coaching sessions are a godsend. Of course, you can also call me in case of acute or smaller issues! <br /></p><br />
