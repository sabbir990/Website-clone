                <h1>Hi, I'm Bob Meijer.</h1>
                <p>As a Google Ads specialist, I help ambitious companies get the most out of Google Ads. I work for a select number of clients and am responsible for over â‚¬1,500,000 per month in ad spend.

                    Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on more than 100 Google Ads accounts. Often challenging accounts from great names, including Weight Watchers, Louwman, Harley Davidson, KPMG, Schoonenberg, and more.

                    I also provide Google Ads courses and 1-on-1 coaching sessions. In these, I share my knowledge with novice to very advanced Google Ads advertisers. This way, they learn the intricacies of the business.</p>
