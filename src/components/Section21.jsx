            <li>Please be on time. Should you join 15 minutes later, our appointment does not extend by 15 minutes. If you book from 09:00 to 10:00, our call will end at 10:00.</li><br />
            <li>The duration of the session booked is strict. If you book 30 minutes, that is precisely how long the session will last. Should we need more time, an additional session can be scheduled.</li><br />
            <li>If there is some time left in the call, a single call cannot be split into multiple calls.</li><br />
            <li>Please try to share as much information with me as possible before our appointment so that I can best help you. If you are not sure whether to mention something or are unsure if certain information is unnecessary, mention it anyway.</li><br />
            <li>Think carefully if your questions can all be addressed in the session you book. If in doubt, please contact me first.</li><br />
            <li>No refund policy applies to these calls. If you have to cancel the appointment for any reason, your money will not be refunded. I can reschedule to another date and time within 7 days before the meeting.</li><br />
