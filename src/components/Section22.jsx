            <h2>Google Ads coach.</h2><br />
            <p>Have you been working with Google Ads for a long time and want to take the next step when it comes to your knowledge about Google Ads? Do you want to get even more returns from your campaigns and take your knowledge level to the next level? But you notice that you are reaching a ceiling and have outgrown regular Google Ads training courses. As your personal Google Ads coach, I help you grow as a Google Ads specialist. Together we determine focus, and spar about the challenges and opportunities we encounter in your account(s).</p><br />
            <h2>Need help with Google Ads?</h2><br />
            <p>You are wondering if I can help you with your Google Ads issues? Sign up for a free initial session with me to discuss your learning goals and Google Ads challenges. This way, you can determine if a Google Ads coaching session is suitable for you, without being tied to monthly fees or a significant investment.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>About your coach.</h2><br />
            <p>My name is Bob Meijer, and I am an experienced Google Ads specialist with over eight years of experience in the business. As a true specialist, I help companies and entrepreneurs get the most out of their Google Ads campaigns. On the one hand, I do this with my own Google Ads agency, and on the other hand, I offer SEA courses, Google Ads courses, and 1-on-1 coaching sessions for everyone who wants to turn the knobs themselves. By still turning the knobs daily, I stay abreast of the latest trends and developments, and my training sessions are always up-to-date.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why 1-on-1 sessions?</h2>
        </div>
        <div className='section22-right'>
            <p>I have often experienced that I went to a training with several colleagues and already knew half of the information. Super frustrating and a waste of your time. And often, you just notice that they have given the training before and that the training is not tailored to your needs and level. So a waste of your time. With my 1-on-1 Google Ads Coaching session, we work purposefully, and with focus on the learning goals you set. This way we both make precious use of our time. The benefits of a 1-on-1 Google Ads coach:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>You determine your own learning goals and thus the content of our coaching sessions.</li>
                <li>You work focused and therefore save time compared to standardized courses.</li>
                <li>And time is money so also financially a 1-on-1 program is more advantageous in the end.</li>
                <li>We apply the knowledge directly in your account(s), so you can achieve results almost immediately.</li>
            </ul><br />
            <h2>Why a Google Ads coach?</h2><br />
            <p>Ads in Google are an integral part of any marketing strategy these days. The platform can be very successful, provided of course it is used properly. Several Google Ads and SEA courses are offered online, but these are often set up for anyone just starting out or wanting to get started with Google Ads. As a Google Ads Specialist with 1 or more years of experience, you actually fall between the cracks. With my 1-on-1 Google Ads coaching sessions, I help you and other advanced specialists to reach the next step within Google Ads. During the Google Ads coaching sessions, we work on your personal learning goals and we start working together in your account. You will not receive a general course, but together we determine the content of your session(s). You can spar with me once or structurally. The choice is yours!</p>
